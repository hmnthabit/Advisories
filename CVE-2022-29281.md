## Information

- Vulnerability: Remote Code Execution
- Affected products: Notable v1.9.0-beta.7 and earlier



## Summary

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Notable (v1.9.0-beta.7 and earlier) due to improper validation of file URI scheme. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted link. 

Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by creating a hyperlink to an SMB share that contains the malicious executable. Once the user clicks the hyperlink within the application, the malicious executable will be executed. Moreover, attackers could steal the user's NTLM credentials through SMB relay attack since the application resolves remote UNC paths.
